# Installation

Install the pre-configured RPi OS image from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O50jPpGj_82jkAokdrsG--k9OBQfMXK5.

**OAK_CM4_POE_V9** works out of the box. I still decided to choose **OAK_CM4_POE_V10** because it's the more recent version (Just noticed one script that didn't work out of the box __rg_depth_aligned.py__)

All required packages are already installed on those images.
